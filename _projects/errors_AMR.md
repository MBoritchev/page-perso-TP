We conduct an error analysis of AMR parsers' outputs in order to characterise these errors and come up with pre- and post- processing heuristics to patch these. We work on data in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish.

Participants:
  - Maria Boritchev
  - Johannes Heinecke
  - Frédéric Herlédan
